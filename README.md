# TruckBackerUpper-ENV
Custom Gymnasium Environment for Truck Backer Upper problem.

This code is an implementation of the Truck Backer Upper problem 
as described in the paper, [An application of the temporal difference algorithm to
the truck backer-upper problem](https://www.esann.org/sites/default/files/proceedings/legacy/es2014-108.pdf)

I have used the [Gynamisum](https://gymnasium.farama.org/index.html) api for the environment.
This is because many standard algorithms already use this.
