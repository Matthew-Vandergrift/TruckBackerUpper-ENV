# TruckBackerUpper-ENV
Custom Gymnasium Environment for Truck Backer Upper

This code is an implementation of the Truck Backer Upper problem 
as described in the paper An application of the temporal difference algorithm to
the truck backer-upper problem

I have used the [Gynamisum](https://gymnasium.farama.org/index.html) api for the environment.
This is because many standard algorithms already use this.
