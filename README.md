# TruckBackerUpper-ENV
Custom Gymnasium Environment for [Truck Backer Upper] (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=298574&tag=1)

This code is an implementation of the Truck Backer Upper problem 
as described in the paper An application of the temporal difference algorithm to
the truck backer-upper problem

I have used the [Gynamisum](https://gymnasium.farama.org/index.html) api for the environment.
This is because many standard algorithms already use this.
